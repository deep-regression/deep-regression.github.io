# Research Beyond Publications

Hi, **Megh** here :wave:,<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
	I am a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at EPFL supervised by Prof. Alexandre Alahi, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/" target="_blank"> Visual Intelligence for Transportation Lab </a>. My research interests lie in uncertainty estimation, active learning and probabilistic modelling for keypoint estimation. These interests are peppered throughout my fledgling  career, most notably during my tenure at Mercedes-Benz. As a computer vision research engineer, I lead R&D in active learning, an academic research area with tangible business benefits. I take pride in not only providing theoretical and applied advancements in active learning <small>[BMVC22, WACV22, CVPRW21]</small>, but also in engineering my research into the project's data pipelines. Taking research beyond publications and into production allowed me a holistic view of the research <i>and</i> development cycle which remains a defining moment in my career.
