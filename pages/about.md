# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
	As a Computer Vision Research Engineer, I have had the privilege of leading research and implementing it in production! At Mercedes-Benz, I worked on solving Active Learning for human pose estimation <small>[WACV22, CVPRW21, Daimler20]</small>. I provided a proof-of-concept and engineered a production pipeline for active learning, identifying limitations with existing methods. Consequently, my research <small>[WACV22, CVPRW21]</small> made key theoretical contributions in active learning theory. A patent <small>[Daimler20]</small> has been filed for my pipeline on in-car active learning; also winning the Mercedes-Benz Innovation Award 2021. My research ideology of fundamentally improving existing methods has its origin in my Masterâ€™s thesis on dimensionality reduction, which addressed the curse of dimensionality prevalent in high-dimensional hyperspectral imagery <small>[ICASSP20]</small>. I was awarded the Institute Silver Medal by IIT Bombay in 2019. </div>
