TOEFL (or Test Of English as a Foreign Language) is a three hour exam that tests four basic abilities in English: reading, listening, speaking and writing. Each section has a scaled weightage of 30, translating into an exam with a maximum cumulative score of 120. I attempted the TOEFL iBT Home Edition in October 2021, and scored 114 (R: 29, L: 28, S: 29, W: 28) with a day and a half of preparation. Although a wealth of material is available online for TOEFL preparation, navigating this landscape is tricky if a person is short on time. In fact, anyone _reasonably_ fluent in English can achieve a good score with less than a week of preparation. The key to crack this exam lies in understanding the exam pattern. This blog details my preparation journey with the hope that an uninitiated reader has a template (this word is heavily associated with TOEFL :D) to prepare for the test. I also detail what worked as well as didn't work for me in hindsight of the exam. I don't advocate waiting till the very end for TOEFL prepatation; however if you do end up with no time to spare (like me), this blog might be of help.

The goal of TOEFL is to prove proficiency in English, and there is no universally accepted score for the same. While most universities recommend a score of 100+ (25+ in each section), a few programs ([Harvard MBA](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/application-process/Pages/international-applicants.aspx)) require 110 and above for consideration. I emphasize on the word _consideration_, most universities consider a TOEFL a necessary but not sufficient condition. A low TOEFL score might form basis for rejection, however a high TOEFL score is a pre-requisite for application screening and serves no role in subsequent admission rounds. _Therefore, our goal is to comfortably clear the minimum requirements, and not to ace the exam._
