International students often require documentation to prove proficiency in English. This guide is for you if you are reasonably fluent in English and consider TOEFL a mere formality. This blog covers the resources I used to prepare for TOEFL along with the time I spent in preparing for each module. TOEFL (or Test Of English as a Foreign Language) is a three hour exam that tests four basic abilities in English: reading, listening, speaking and writing. Each section has a scaled weightage of 30, translating into an exam with a maximum cumulative score of 120. I attempted the TOEFL iBT Home Edition in October 2021, and scored 114 (R: 29, L: 28, S: 29, W: 28) with a day and a half of preparation. Although a wealth of material is available online for TOEFL preparation, navigating this landscape is tricky if a person is short on time. In fact, anyone _reasonably_ fluent in English can achieve a good score with less than a week of preparation. The key to crack this exam lies in understanding the exam pattern. This blog details my preparation journey with the hope that an uninitiated reader has a template (this word is heavily associated with TOEFL :D) to prepare for the test. I also detail what worked as well as didn't work for me in hindsight of the exam. I don't advocate waiting till the very end for TOEFL prepatation; however if you do end up with no time to spare (like me), this blog might be of help.

The goal of TOEFL is to prove proficiency in English, and there is no universally accepted score for the same. While most universities recommend a score of 100+ (25+ in each section), a few programs ([Harvard MBA](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/application-process/Pages/international-applicants.aspx)) require 110 and above for consideration. I emphasize on the word _consideration_, most universities consider a TOEFL a necessary but not sufficient condition. A low TOEFL score might form basis for rejection, however a high TOEFL score is a pre-requisite for application screening and serves no role in subsequent admission rounds. _Therefore, our goal is to comfortably clear the minimum requirements, and not to ace the exam._ 

## 1. Preparation

With 24 hours to spare, we can't dedicate a lot of time to study resources (free or paid) for TOEFL. I referred TOEFL's free study material for the reading and listening section, which consists of questions taken from previous TOEFL exams. 

#### Reading Section - TOEFL iBT Free Resources (3 Practice Sets)

The reading material (multiple choice) consists of three practice sets, which should take an hour to complete. The reading section consists of 9/10 questions each for one mark, with the last question for two marks and requires an effective reading of the comprehension. Each of the one-mark questions either asks you to identify key arguments in a given paragraph, alternative statements for a highlighted sentence, synonyms for highlighted words with the final question based on key points spanning the entire comprehension. The format of the questions allows for multiple test taking strategies. Each question and its solution is dedicated to a specific paragraph. This allows test takers to skip reading the paragraph and head straight to the questions in order to save valuable time. Did I mention that TOEFL provides roughly 18 minutes per comprehension? Skipping the paragraph and heading for the questions saves valuable time which would otherwise have been utilized in reading the lengthy comprehension. An alternative test strategy (the one I used) is to skim through the comprehension. This essentially allows us to establish a flow between paragraphs, and gives us an idea of the overall picture that the writer is trying to establish through the text. On a personal note, I am a person who loves reading, and skimming through the paragraph helped me vaguely anticipate the key questions from the paragraph.


#### Listening Section - TOEFL iBT Free Resources (7 Practice Sets)

The listening section should be the easiest if you know what kind of notes to take. Unlike American sitcoms which have a large variation in pitch and rumble, the audio for the listening sections are crisp, clear and with a heavy emphasis on correct pronounciation. If you watch English television shows (British or American) with light/moderate use of subtitles, you're good to go. The questions are framed in two distinct formats such as a lecture (audio) or a student-professor conversation. The essence of the listening section is in understanding the intent and not memorization of facts (which can be scribbled down). For instance, a common first question in the student-professor conversation is why did the student visit the professor? For the listening section, I chose the strategy of scribbling in shorthand every detail from the audio tracks. I believe this is not the optimal strategy, but with limited preparation time this strategy remains the safest.
