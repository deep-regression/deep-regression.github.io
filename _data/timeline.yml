  description: Computer Vision Research Engineer, MBUX Intelligent Interior <br> I had the privilege of joining Brijesh Pillai and Partha Bhattacharya's team and MBRDI straight out of campus! One of my main accomplishments over these three years was in research and development of an active learning pipeline. I am grateful to Brijesh and Partha who continue to be excellent <s>managers</s> mentors to their teams.

  description: I wrote my Master's thesis on Dimensionality Reduction under the guidance of Prof. Krishna Mohan Buddhiraju (BK Mohan) and Prof. Biplab Banerjee. AP grades at IIT Bombay are handed out for exceptional performance (top ~2%) in a course, and I was fortunate (yes I worked hard too :D) to secure three in one semester. I am especially grateful to Prof. BK Mohan who encouraged me to dream and allowed me to take academic risks. My journey at IIT culminated in winning an Institute Silver Medal conferred by the Union Minister of Education, Government of India.

  description: My formative years were spent at Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCE). I believe that my undergraduation played the biggest role in shaping my personality from being an introvert to being less of an introvert. I competed (and won) elections for leadership roles in the college's cultural fest, which my introvert side still cannot believe to this day. Academics are important, and so are inter-personal skills which remains my key takeaway from my undergraduate years. Moreover, I am thankful to Prof. Amit Deshmukh who hand-held me during my first steps into the world of research :')
