# A Mathematical Analysis Of Learning Loss For Active Learning In Regression
Author(s): **Megh Shukla**, Shuaib Ahmed  

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
